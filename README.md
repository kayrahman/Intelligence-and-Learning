## Machine Learning:

### Classification and Regression:

- Classification:
  Classification refers to taking an input and classify it into a discrete set of labels.
- Regression:
  Regression refers to predicticting some sort of continuous numeric output.
  
  Some flavours (Algorithms) of Machine Learning recipies are <br>
   * KNN - K Nearest Neighbour
   * SVM - Support Vector Machine
   * ANN - Artificial Neural Network
   
 Three core types of learning that are applied to Machine Learning:
   - Supervised Learning.
     * Training Data
     * Test Data
     * Unknown Data
    
   - Unsupervised Learning.
      This Learning is applied on the data we know nothing about. It applies to the problems like clustering or finding patterns of some unknow dataset.
   - Reinforement Learning:
        Reinforcement Learning is a kind of learning where an agent observes the environment and chooses an action. 
   


### Transfer Learning:
  - Features Extractor.
      * Layers
      * Vectors
      * Convolution
  - Classification
  
  - Regression : Instead of using a label training data with assigning number to them.
  
  - Linear Regression:
    * Ordinary Least squares:
    
    $\alpha$ $\beta$


### Neural Network :

- Supervised Learning:
  - perceptron Algorithm
    * For every input Multiply that input by it's weight and sum all the weighted inputs.
    * That weighted sum passes through an activation function
    * That activation function gives us a plus or negative one
   
   This whole process is call feed forward.
   
 Gradient Descent:
      * How we initialize the weights and tweek it
